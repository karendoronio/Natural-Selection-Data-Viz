## Learn About Natural Selection
Explore the 3 main types of Natural Selection:
- **Directional Selection**: one extreme of a trait leads to higher fitness
  - E.g., darker moths blending in with soot-covered trees
- **Stabilizing Selection**: moderate traits are favored over extremes
  - E.g., finch beak sizes remaining optimal to consume seeds
- **Diversifying Selection**: extremes are favored over moderate traits
  - E.g., light and dark mice which blend into different aspects of their environment
